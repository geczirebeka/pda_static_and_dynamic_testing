### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

# the name of the function should be snake case
  def checkforAce(card)
  # double equal signs are needed instead of one
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

# def instead of dif, and a comma is needed after card1 in the brackets
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  
  if card1.value > card2.value
  # should be return card1
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
  # indentation is wrong for the whole function and there is an extra 'end'
end
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
# should be total = 0
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    # should be an 'end' here
    return "You have a total of" + total
    # this 'next' end is not needed
  end
end
# an 'end' is needed to close the whole class
```
